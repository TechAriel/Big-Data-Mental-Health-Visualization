# Mental Health Data Analysis Project

## Project Description
This project, titled "Exploring Mental Health Trends: Insights from Visual Analysis and Big Data Techniques," is conducted as part of the Visualization for Data Analytics module. It aims to explore the intricate relationships within a large mental health dataset, focusing on treatment-seeking behavior, work interest, and the impact of family history on mental health. Through a combination of Python for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis and PySpark for big data handling, this research provides robust visualizations and big data analysis to inform better mental health strategies.

## Installation
To run this project locally, clone the repository and install the necessary packages:

git clone https://github.com/TechAriel/mental-health-data-analysis.git

cd mental-health-data-analysis

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Dataset Description
The dataset encompasses responses from 292,364 individuals across 35 countries, with a significant number of responses from the United States and the United Kingdom. It includes demographic information and mental health indicators, facilitating an in-depth analysis of mental health trends.

## Data Preprocessing
A series of preprocessing steps were applied to optimize the data for analysis, including duplicate removal, missing value imputation, data transformation, and categorical encoding.

## Data Visualization
The project features numerous visualizations that explore various aspects of mental health, such as the effects of work interest and family history on treatment seeking. These visualizations aid in understanding the dynamics affecting mental health outcomes across different demographics.

## Big Data Analysis Techniques
This section details the use of big data technologies like PySpark, which provided the infrastructure for handling and analyzing the large-scale dataset. The experience and insights gained from using these technologies are documented here.

## Usage
After installation, execute the script to process the data and generate visualizations:

python MentalHealthDatasetAnalysis.py
